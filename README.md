## FAQ

#### Why choose React.js as front-end framework.

- *Reusable Components*

    One of the main benefits of using React JS is its potential 
    to reuse components.

- *It helps to build rich user interfaces*

    React allows building such high-quality, rich user 
    interfaces through its declarative components.

- *It allows writing custom components*

    React comes with JSX, an optional syntax extension, which 
    makes it possible to write your own components.

- *It offers fast rendering*

    React.js provides a virtual DOM feature. Virtual DOM, as the 
    name suggests, is the virtual representation of DOM that allows 
    testing all changes to the virtual DOM first to calculate 
    risks with each modification.
